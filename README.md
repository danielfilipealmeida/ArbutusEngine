# Arbutus Engine

The Arbutus Engine is a C++ library that uses openFrameworks for creating Real-time Video mixing applications.
Along with the Library, a TCP Server is also implemented for rendering video output.


## Roadmap

- Migrate the lib to a Header-only Library
- Implement the code using functional programming as much as possible
- Add documentation to the Library
- Test all! get full coverage if possible
- Add IPC to the server to allow a faster communication between server and client on the same machine
- Implement all actions on the server through JSON messages via HTTP or IPC
- 

## Compiling

This project uses submodules. When cloning this from Github please do the following:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/danielfilipealmeida/ArbutusEngine.git
    
There are several targets on XCode:

* the Library
* an Hello world app
* a TCP server that can be used as an example and a real app.

All dependencies will be retrieve from github and present inside the `External`  folder. Everything is ready for compiling.

## Updating

git submodule update --init --recursive


## Notes

### Xcode command line

#### Project information

xcodebuild -list -project ArbutusEngine.xcodeproj/


#### Compiling

xcodebuild -scheme ArbutusLib build

## Documentation

Code is documented with HeaderDoc.

- [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/)

## Work todo


- ZMQ IPC client and server example using barebone ZMQ
- add documentation placemarks on all functions
- implement IPC 
- REMOVE ALL SINGLETON PATTERNS
- Decent logging

- fix generated json of the state
- break the current shader into parts. have one shader per effect
- create a shader for helping on the transitions: a shader that applies a grayscale fbo to the alpha channel of another fbo
- create a transition object, that receives: channel A fbo, channel B fbo, transition visual, visual position. it can also receive a transition duration. (maybe another method)
- save output to disk
- continue working on the cmake configuration but for cross compiling to Linux and raspberry pi
- prepare a vagrant box to compile this project inside
